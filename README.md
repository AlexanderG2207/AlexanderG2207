# Hi, I'm Alex! 👋

I'm an Information Systems student at the Technical University of Munich. My journey into the world of technology has led me to explore various programming languages, focusing on mobile development with Swift and backend development with Java.

## 🔭 Currently Working On 

Currently, I am working on my thesis project in collaboration with the [TUM Applied Software Engineering Chair](https://ase.cit.tum.de/), titled "Design Anywhere: UML Modeling on Mobile Devices". The goal is to allow students to partake in UML modeling exercises from the comfort of their mobile devices.
